# You can record anything on your screen as a video file and save it to your local offline system to watch again later.

Do a 15 second test of the media to make sure both video and audio are working.

On Windows:
alt + windows key + r
the output is saved in the 'captures' folder of the 'videos' folder

On Linux:
ctrl + alt + shift + r
the output is saved in the 'videos' folder



if a media-streaming service uses DRM to prohibit screenrecording, the image will appear dark in the final output.
The image still exists on the CPU even tho it's being rendered by the GPU. Go to your browser settings and search for "use hardware acceleration"
Make sure "hardware acceleration" is turned off and restart the browser. Screen recording should be possible.
